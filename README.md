Comprehensive monitoring in North American bats reveals low body mass and reproductive status as predictors of coronavirus shedding 


### Repo Contents

- scripts: contains the source .R and .stan files to reproduce the anaysis. Each file is detailed below in the specific sections corresponding to the statistical analyses.
- data: contains the raw source data and model generated output.
- figures: contains the final output figures from the manuscript. 

### 1. System Requirements

#### Hardware Requirements

Our source code requires only a standard computer. Much of the Markov chain Monte Carlo code is run in parallel so a computer with ample memory and multiple cores can be advantageous. The runtimes below are generated using a macbook with the recommended specs (64 GB RAM, 8 cores at 2.7 GHz). The code will also work on linux or windows computer.

#### Software Requirements

Reproducing the statistical analyses requires a current version of R and stan. We use version 4.5.0 of R and version 2.32.7 of stan.

#### Package dependencies and versions

Users will need the following packages install the following packages to execute the code. Our versions are effective March 27, 2026

```
tidyverse 2.0.0
lubridate 1.9.3
stringr 1.5.1
rstan 2.32.6
cowplot 1.1.3
ggtext 0.1.2
jpeg 0.1-10
scales 1.3.0
tictoc 1.2.1
```


### 2. Installation Guide

Running the analysis requires:

- installing R. Depending on wifi speeds, installing R usually takes a few minutes.
- installing stan. Depending on wifi speeds, installing stan usually takes a few minutes.
- installing the necessary R packages (listed above). Depending on wifi speeds, installing packages usually takes about 30 seconds per package.
